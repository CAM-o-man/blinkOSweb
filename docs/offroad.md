# Vanish in a blink

Offroad mode blocks *all* telemtery on the device, making you impossible to track.  
Bluetooth? Blocked.  
Wifi? Blocked.  
Cellular? Blocked.  
GPS? Blocked.  
With Offroad, you're invisible.

In addition, it also puts you into Lockdown mode, preventing all biometric logins
and hiding your sensitive notifications.
