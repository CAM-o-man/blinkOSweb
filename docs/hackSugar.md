# Who We Are
We are an organisation known as hackSugar, a group of several programmers and software developers 
committed to open-source and to making lives better through open-source software.

## Our Organisation
hackSugar is a not-for-profit tech group consisting of the cool people you see below. We believe in software that respects your privacy, software that has a purpose, and software to share with everyone.

## Our Members
