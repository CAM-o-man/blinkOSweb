# Safe from prying eyes

Camouflage allows you to type in an alternate PIN and be redirected to a new, empty account
containing none of your data or apps, while hiding and encrypting your real data.
When you're forced to unlock your phone, simply put in the Camouflage PIN and it looks like you've never
done anything in your life.
