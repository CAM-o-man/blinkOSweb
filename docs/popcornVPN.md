# popcornVPN

popcornVPN is a fork of OpenVPN modified to include VPN-hopping, which drastically increases your privacy and security.

## What is a VPN?

A VPN, or virtual private network, is a "tunnel" to another location that all your internet traffic is sent through.
It can make it appear as though you're in a different location, and can help ensure that none of your traffic is
isolated and intercepted. 

### How might a VPN be compromised?

A VPN will send all of the internet traffic on your device to a different server, and *only then* route it to the 
real destination. However, this makes certain that all of your traffic will be travelling along the same route
for an extended period of time. This makes it easy for a determined attacker to look at and read your traffic.

### How does popcornVPN keep me secure?

popcornVPN makes use of a technology known as "VPN Hopping", which makes use of multiple servers. When you are connected
to popcornVPN, every 45 minutes, by default, the connection will be "hopped" to a different server. This makes it appear as though, instead
of being connected to a VPN, you are actually just browsing the Internet as normal. This simple lack of knowledge makes
it considerably more difficult for an attacker to isolate and intercept your traffic.

### How can I know you're telling the truth?

popcornVPN, like our other products, is open source, meaning you can view the code at any time you'd like. Simply
click the "View on GitHub" button at the top of the page, or alternatively, download the archive as (for Windows users)
a .zip file, or (for Linux or Mac users) a tarballed archive. 

#### You can even contribute!

If you know how to code, feel free to clone our Git repository at the top of the page. If you'd like to fork it and
make a product of your own, too, that's fine as well, however please read our license, also at the top of the page.

## Get popcornVPN

popcornVPN is now available on the Google Play Store. Unfortunately, the iOS version is still in
development, but we'll tell you here as soon as it is available. 

### For those without the Google Play Store:

If you're running an alternative operating system like LineageOS or blinkOS, without access to the Google
Play store, you can download and install the app manually with the APK at the top of the page.
