## Option 1: Let us install blinkOS

If you feel you aren't confident in installing blinkOS, then we can do it for you. Simply mail your phone
to {ADDRESS HERE} and we will install it and send it back, for a small fee.
Please check our [list of supported devices](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/)
before sending your phone.

## Option 2: A new phone with blinkOS

If you'd like to get a new phone with blinkOS installed, simply order your phone from us, and we will
send you that phone with blinkOS installed. We only offer phones on our [list of supported devices
](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/), unfortunately.
