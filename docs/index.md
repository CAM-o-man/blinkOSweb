# blinkOS

blinkOS is a free, open-source operating system designed for privacy.

## Why blinkOS?

> Here in your mind you have complete privacy. Here there's no difference between what is and what could be.

Companies today use your phone to mine your data. Sometimes, this is a good thing. Data can
be used to improve the product or your experience of the product. Sometimes, however, this
data-mining is used only to gain data on you to sell, or to advertise.

#### blinkOS prevents data mining.

*   blinkOS will send chaff and garbage data to fool data-miners, without compromising you or your privacy.
*   blinkOS can prevent an app from requesting data from the phone or other apps on the phone.
*   blinkOS can ensure your data remains secure from even the most determined of data-miners.

##### When blinkOS detects data mining, it will:

1.  Inform you of the mining and allow you to choose whether or not it should continue.
2.  If you choose to stop it, it will attempt to force the app to cease data requests.
3.  If the app refuses to cease requests, it will feed the app garbage data to keep your real data private.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
