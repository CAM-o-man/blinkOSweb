# About blinkOS

blinkOS is a free, open-source operating system designed for privacy. 

## Why blinkOS?

> Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.  
> -Edward Snowden

Companies today use your phone to mine your data. Sometimes, this is a good thing. Data can
be used to improve the product or your experience of the product. Sometimes, however, this
data-mining is used only to gain data on you to sell, or to advertise.

#### blinkOS prevents data mining.

*   blinkOS will send chaff and garbage data to fool data-miners, without compromising you or your privacy.
*   blinkOS can prevent an app from requesting data from the phone or other apps on the phone.
*   blinkOS can ensure your data remains secure from even the most determined of data-miners.

##### When blinkOS detects data mining, it will:

1.  Inform you of the mining and allow you to choose whether or not it should continue.
2.  If you choose to stop it, it will attempt to force the app to cease data requests.
3.  If the app refuses to cease requests, it will feed the app garbage data to keep your real data private.

## How do I know you're keeping my data private?

Most companies offer software that is "closed-source", which means you can't view the software
and you can't know if they do what they say they do. Apple, for example, claims to protect
user privacy, but *you can't know that they keep their promise* because you can't view the code.

#### blinkOS is open-source.
