# Why blinkOS?

> Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.  
> -Edward Snowden

In the modern day, surveillance is everywhere, and in many places, it's closer to a police state
than it may seem at first glance. Traffic is tracked, people are suppressed, and those that attempt
to make society a better place are silenced, either with blackmail, threats, or force.

### blinkOS keeps you invisible
* Our Offroad feature disables all radios and telemetry, so you can never be tracked.
* Lockdown ensures that your information can't be accessed without your authentication.
* Camouflage ensures that if you're caught unawares and forced to unlock your phone, your data 
will be kept hidden
* Secure wipe keeps your phone looking innocuous while your data is shredded with military-grade data destruction.
